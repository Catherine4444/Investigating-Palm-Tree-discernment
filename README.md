# Investigating-Palm-Tree-discernment
The project uses K- Means, DBSCAN and Spectral clustering on features derived from Histogram of Oriented Gradients, Local Binary Pattern, Grey level Co-occurrence Matrix and Greyscale Histogram to tackle the classification of palm trees. Z-normalisation, PCA and kth-nearest neighbour was also used to enhance predictions.
